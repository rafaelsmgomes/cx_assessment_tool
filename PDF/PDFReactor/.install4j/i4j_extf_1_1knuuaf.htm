        <h2>SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT</h2>
        <p class="disclaimer">READ CAREFULLY BEFORE COPYING, INSTALLING OR USING THIS SOFTWARE.</p>
        <h3>Article 1 - GENERAL</h3>
        <p>This Software License Agreement (hereinafter "this Agreement") is a legal agreement between you, the customer
            or licensee (either an individual or a legal entity that directly or indirectly acquires this Software for
            installation on its application or system) and RealObjects GmbH. The copyright of this software (hereinafter
            "the Software" or "PDFreactor&reg;") and its associated documentation (including any files, source code,
            images, photographs, animations and text incorporated into the Software, but excluding any third-party
            software and open source software) as well as any accompanying written materials is owned by RealObjects
            GmbH ("the Owner" or "RealObjects") whose registered office is at Altenkesseler Str. 17/B6, 66115
            Saarbruecken, Germany, and is protected by German copyright laws and regulations and, as far as these are
            implemented into German law, by international treaties.</p>
        <p>By downloading, installing, copying or otherwise using the Software, you agree with the Owner to be bound by
            the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which will govern your use of the Software. If you do not agree
            to this Agreement, do not download, install or use the Software. Any offence against this Agreement will be
            prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. You will be held responsible for any employees or users who
            receive the Software and in turn make unauthorized copies.</p>
        <p>You may copy the Software to another disk or media, for the purpose of backup protection only in the event of
            a system wide crash. Installation of the Software onto a system that you use, means that you have accepted
            and agreed to the terms that govern the use of copyrighted software.</p>
        <h3>Article 2 - GRANT OF LICENSE</h3>
        <p>RealObjects grants to you and you accept, subject to the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement, a
            nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, and revocable right to use the Software solely and strictly
            in accordance with the following conditions and restrictions. You hold full responsibility for assuring that
            all users of the Software provided access under the provisions of the Software license adhere to all
            provisions and prohibitions of this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>FREE PERSONAL License.</strong> Install and use the Software for private, non-commercial and non-professional purposes 
            or applications on 1 (one) personally owned or controlled physical or virtual machine with unlimited CPU cores, 
            subject to limited product liability, which is accepted with the download or the installation of the Software. 
            The FREE PERSONAL License is only applicable for a natural person, not a legal person or legal entity. For the 
            FREE PERSONAL License of the Software RealObjects excludes all warranty and liability claims, except in the 
            case of deliberate intention or gross negligence. The liability, warranty, support and maintenance claims arising 
            from the RealObjects commercial licenses of the Software do not apply to the FREE PERSONAL License.
            PDF documents and other files generated using the FREE PERSONAL License include notices that identify PDFreactor&reg;. 
            You are not allowed to remove or change these notices or assist or encourage third parties to remove or change 
            such notices.
            If the FREE PERSONAL License is used to regularly generate PDF documents or other files, a prominent link to 
            the website www.pdfreactor.com (<code>&lt;a href="https://www.pdfreactor.com"&gt;HTML to PDF conversion provided by PDFreactor&lt;/a&gt;</code>) 
            has to be presented on the web pages from where the generated PDF documents or other files derive or are 
            retrieved, and in case of a well-known web page where business or technology partners are listed. If the 
            PDF documents and other files are sent as e-mail attachments or embedded into e-mails, all e-mail messages 
            must contain the notice <em>"Produced by RealObjects PDFreactor&reg; - www.pdfreactor.com"</em> in the message body.</p>
        <p><strong>CPU License</strong>. Install and use the Software on 1 (one) physical or virtual machine or isolated software container. 
            The Software may be used only on the licensed physical or virtual machine or isolated software container containing up to 4 (four) 
            CPU cores (as detected by the Software). One license key of the Software must not be used on multiple physical machines, multiple 
            virtual machines, multiple isolated software containers or any combination thereof. Additional Licenses must be obtained to use 
            the Software on multiple physical or virtual machines or isolated software containers or on machines with more than 4 (four) CPU 
            cores.</p>
        <p><strong>SERVER License</strong>. Install and use the Software on 1 (one) physical or virtual machine with unlimited CPU cores.
            The Software may be used only on the licensed physical or virtual machine. Licenses for additional machines
            can be purchased</p>
        <p>Subject to availability are specially tagged server licenses of the Software, which may be used only on the
            licensed physical or virtual machine for use with a named application (hereinafter &ldquo;the Licensed
            Application&rdquo;), but only insofar as the Software constitutes an inferior component integrated and
            embedded in a superior feature set of the Licensed Application. You shall not expose to end users of the
            Licensed Application the Software&rsquo;s API or documentation used for the integration of the Software with
            the Licensed Application. You are not permitted to integrate, install or use the Software in applications
            other than the Licensed Application. Additional terms and conditions may apply.</p>
        <p><strong>CORPORATE APPLICATION License</strong>. Subject to availability and additional terms and conditions.</p>
        <p>Active/Passive. The only permissible exception to the above requirements for a CPU License or SERVER License is a purely
            passive machine or server in an active/passive fail-over cluster. If the Software is used in a clustered
            environment, the licensee may use the Software on a temporary basis on a machine or server that is employed
            only for fail-over support (the "passive machine or server") as long as the number of CPU cores on the
            passive machine or server does not exceed the number of CPU cores on the licensee&rsquo;s primary active
            machine or server. In this configuration, the passive machine or server does not require a separate CPU
            License or SERVER License. Active/active configurations require licensing of both machines or servers as usual.</p>
        <p>You are not permitted to:</p>
        <p>(a) make copies of, or distribute any parts of the Software, except for backup, archival and disaster
            recovery purposes.</p>
        <p>(b) rent, lease, sub-license, loan, copy, modify, alter, adapt, merge, translate, reverse engineer,
            decompile, or re-package the Software into another product, or to disassemble it or create derivative works,
            based on the whole, or any part, of the Software or its associated documentation. Reverse engineering and
            modification however is permitted for those parts of the Software that are based on third-party software or
            open source software which is licensed under a different license, but only if required by that license or in
            case of statutory provisions.</p>
        <p>(c) copy the Software for the purpose of illegal distribution.</p>
        <p>RealObjects will provide you with an unlock key which enables the use of the Software license. The
            information contained in the unlock key will include among others the type of license and the number of
            licensed CPU cores, the number of licensed servers or the name of the Licensed Application. 
            You might also have to provide the name(s) of the machine(s) on which the Software will
            be installed. RealObjects further reserves the right to introduce and use appropriate license enforcement
            techniques in its software, which are designed to prevent illegal use or distribution of the Software. The
            license enforcement techniques might require activation of the Software license. This may require
            establishing a temporary network connection to a RealObjects web service. RealObjects reserves all rights to
            modify the license enforcement techniques used in the Software at any time.</p>
        <p>If you have an evaluation or demonstration license of the Software, you may download, install and use the
            Software on your machine for evaluation or demonstration purposes only. You are not allowed to use the
            evaluation or demonstration license for commercial or production purposes. The evaluation and demonstration
            licenses might be time limited and may include other restrictions in terms of functionality.</p>
        <p>Application Service Provider (ASP). An ASP is a service firm which deploys, manages, and delivers application
            capabilities to multiple entities from a data center, across a wide area network, or through
            centrally-located machine(s) or server(s) under a "rental" or lease agreement, free of charge or at cost.
            Except for the limitation described below, the CPU License of the Software can be utilized as part of an ASP
            service offering whereby you provide web-based software and hosting of that software for use by third
            parties for a fee or free of charge.</p>
        <p>Software as a Service (SaaS). SaaS is a software delivery model in which software and associated data are
            centrally hosted in the cloud. SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.
            Except for the limitation described below, the CPU License of the Software can be utilized as part of a SaaS
            service offering whereby you provide web-based software and hosting of that software for use by third
            parties for a fee or free of charge.</p>
        <p>Limitation of ASP and SaaS utilization. You are not permitted to use the CPU License, SERVER License and 
            CORPORATE APPLICATION License of the Software as part of your ASP or SaaS offering in order to provide 
            XML/XHTML/HTML + CSS printing functionality, which substantially duplicates the functionality of the 
            Software. PDFreactor&reg; functionality as part of any kind of ASP or SaaS offering is only permitted as 
            long as the PDFreactor functionality remains an inferior functionality as part of a superior ASP or SaaS
            feature set or service.</p>
        <h3>Article 3 - SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE</h3>
        <p>The 1 Year Support &amp; Maintenance subscription entitles you to receive priority technical support and all
            maintenance releases or updates or upgrades for the duration of the Support Period. The subscription for
            year 1 is covered through the purchase of the Software license or the related upgrade. It is optional for
            year 2 and beyond. You can renew the 1 Year Support &amp; Maintenance until the end of the Support
            Period.</p>
        <p>If you have a valid 1 Year Support &amp; Maintenance subscription for the Software license, you will receive
            the Software and all maintenance releases or updates or upgrades for the duration of the Support Period,
            which may or may not include additional features. Updates and maintenance releases cover the minor releases
            within the same major version of the Software that you have purchased. Upgrades to the next major version
            are also included in this maintenance. In addition, RealObjects will provide Priority Technical Support to
            you for the duration of the Support Period. Priority Technical Support is provided via a web-based support
            form only, and RealObjects will make commercially reasonable efforts to respond via e-mail to all requests
            within forty-eight (48) hours during RealObjects&rsquo; business hours (Mo - Fr, 09:00 - 18:00 CET, German
            holidays excluded).</p>
        <p>Technical support only covers issues or questions resulting directly out of the operation of the Software and
            RealObjects will not provide you with generic consultation, assistance, or advice under any
            circumstances.</p>
        <p>Following the release of a new version of the Software, RealObjects will provide support & maintenance only 
           for the new version from its official release date on. Issues or bugs found or reported by the customer must
           be reproducible in the latest officially available release of the Software and will be fixed in a new 
           version (including major versions, maintenance releases and updates) only. Updating the Software may require
           the updating of software not covered by this Agreement before installation. Updates of the operating system
           and application software not specifically covered by this Agreement are your responsibility and will not be
           provided by RealObjects under this Agreement.</p>
        <p>RealObjects&rsquo; obligations under this Article 3 are contingent upon your proper use of the Software and
            your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement at all times. RealObjects shall be under no
            obligation to provide the above technical support if, in RealObjects&rsquo; opinion, the Software has failed
            due to the following conditions: (i) damage caused by the relocation of the Software to another location or
            CPU; (ii) alterations, modifications or attempts to change the Software without RealObjects&rsquo; written
            approval; (iii) causes external to the Software, such as natural disasters, the failure or fluctuation of
            electrical power, or computer equipment failure; or (iv) your failure to maintain the Software at
            RealObjects&rsquo; specified release level.</p>
        <p>It will be your responsibility to: (i) comply with all RealObjects-specified operating and troubleshooting
            procedures and then notify RealObjects immediately of the Software malfunction and provide RealObjects with
            complete information thereof; (ii) provide for the security of your confidential information; (iii)
            establish and maintain backup systems and procedures necessary to reconstruct lost or altered files, data or
            programs.</p>
        <h3>Article 4 - TERM AND TERMINATION</h3>
        <p>This Agreement and the licensing rights provided to you shall continue for an indefinite term. This Agreement
            will terminate if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. RealObjects may
            terminate this Agreement or suspend your usage rights and support entitlement, if the applicable license
            fees or applicable support and maintenance subscription fees are not fully paid to RealObjects by you or a
            third-party.</p>
        <h3>Article 5 - OWNERSHIP</h3>
        <p>The Software is licensed to you. You do not own it. The Owner shall at all times retain ownership of the
            Software as well as all subsequent copies thereof, regardless of form or storage medium. The owner also
            retains the title, and all proprietary rights to the Software, including, but not limited to, all patent,
            copyright, trade secret, service marks, registered service marks, trademark or registered trademark
            rights.</p>
        <p>You agree to protect the confidentiality of the Software, the documentation as well as any accompanying
            written materials. You agree that you will not provide a copy of the Software or documentation or any
            accompanying written materials nor divulge any proprietary information of RealObjects to any person, other
            than your employees, without the prior consent of RealObjects. You shall use the best efforts to see that
            any user of the Software licensed hereunder complies with all provisions and prohibitions this Agreement.
            The Software may include third-party software or open source software which may have its own copyright and
            its own applicable license conditions. In order to use the Software you must accept and comply with those
            license conditions. The third-party or open source licenses may be found in the "license" directory of the
            Software, other materials accompanying the software package, the documentation or corresponding source files
            at www.realobjects.com.</p>
        <h3>Article 6 - HIGH-RISK-ACTIVITIES</h3>
        <p>The Software is not designed or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring failsafe controls,
            including without limitation operation or maintenance of any nuclear facilities, on-line control of
            aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation or aircraft communications, and life support or weapons systems,
            in which the failure of the Software could lead to death, personal injury, or serve physical or
            environmental damage. RealObjects specially disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such
            high-risk activities.</p>
        <h3>Article 7 - ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h3>
        <p>You acknowledge that due to the complexity of the Software, it is possible that use of the Software could
            lead to the unintentional loss or corruption of data. You assume all risks of such data loss or corruption.
            The warranties provided in this License do not cover any damage or losses resulting from data loss or
            corruption.</p>
        <h3>Article 8 - DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</h3>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, REALOBJECTS DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY FOR THIS SOFTWARE AND THE
            SERVICES, UNLESS OTHERWISE REGULATED BY LAW. IN ANY CASE THE WARRANTY FOR THIS SOFTWARE IS LIMITED TO ONE
            YEAR; STARTING FROM THE DELIVERY DATE. THIS SOFTWARE, THE RELATED SERVICES AND ANY RELATED DOCUMENTATION OR
            OTHER INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR
            OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY
            QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF THE
            USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT REMAINS WITH YOU.</p>
        <p>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN CASE OF A WARRANTY CLAIM, REALOBJECTS SHALL BE ENTITLED AT ITS DISCRETION
            TO EITHER REMEDY THE FAULT OR TO MAKE A SUBSTITUTE DELIVERY. IF A SUBSEQUENT IMPROVEMENT FAILS, OR IF NO
            SUBSTITUTE DELIVERY IS MADE WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME THE LICENSEE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO ASSERT HIS RIGHT TO
            CANCELLATION OF THE CONTRACT OR DIMINUTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFECTIVE CONTRACT
            SOFTWARE.</p>
        <p>DAMAGE CLAIMS AS A RESULT OF CULPA IN CONTRAHENDO, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS ACTS AGAINST REALOBJECTS
            ARE EXCLUDED EXCEPT (I) IN CASES OF WRONGFUL INTENT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, (II) IN THE EVENT OF AN ASSUMPTION
            OF AN EXPRESS QUALITY GUARANTY (IN GERMAN: BESCHAFFENHEITSGARANTIE) OR AN EXPRESS DURABILITY GUARANTY (IN
            GERMAN: HALTBARKEITSGARANTIE), OR (III) DAMAGES CAUSED BY ANY HARM TO LIFE, BODY OR HEALTH. THIS EXCLUSION
            SHALL NOT APPLY IN CASES OF ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE IF MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED, BUT
            IN THIS CASE EACH PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE ONLY FOR COMPENSATION OF TYPICAL, FORESEEABLE DAMAGES. ANY LIABILITY
            FOR INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES E.G. LOST PROFITS SHALL BE EXCLUDED IN ALL CASES. IN NO EVENT SHALL
            THE OWNER&rsquo;S LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE.</p>

            SUPPLIERS, PUBLIC DISORDER, RIOTS, FIRE, INUNDATION, STORM, EARTHQUAKE, WAR, ACTS OF GOVERNMENT, WORKING
            CONDITIONS OR OTHER REASONS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE RELEVANT PARTY.</p>
        <h3>Article 9 - FINAL PROVISIONS</h3>
        <p>(1) Entire Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to create, and does not create, any partnership, joint
            venture, agency, fiduciary, employment, or other relationship between the parties, beyond the relationship
            of independent parties to a commercial contract. Neither party is, nor will either party hold itself out to
            be, vested with any authority to bind the other party contractually, or to act on behalf of the other party
            as a broker, agent, or otherwise.</p>

        <p>(3) Waiver. The waiver or failure of either party to exercise any right provided for herein will not be
            deemed a waiver of any further right hereunder. The rights and remedies of the parties set forth in this
            Agreement are in addition to any rights or remedies the parties may otherwise have at law or equity.</p>

            claiming by or through them, that the sole jurisdiction and venue for any litigation arising from or
            relating to this Agreement will be an appropriate court located in Germany, and licensee specifically waives
            any objection that such jurisdiction and venue constitute an inconvenient forum.</p>
